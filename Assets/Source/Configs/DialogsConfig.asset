    - Overlord, you've almost settled this area
    - It won't be long before we can go and conquer the rest of the land!
    - All these lands and their inhabitants belong to you. They just don't know it
      yet
    - Let's accumulate our strength and continue the offensive. Improve your base
      a little more first, then we can get back at the pitty humans

    - Overlord, you've already gathered enough resources to set up a base here that
      can stand up to the humans. It's time to move on!
    - Don't worry, your progress at the last location will be saved
    - Pretty empty, but I'm sure you can quickly improve our new den! I think I had
      a nice spell somewhere
    - Well done, my Lord! With this, we can quickly restore our strength

    Dialogs:
    - Looks like the people weren't helped by their ponies. You're back on the horse,
      Lord!
    - Let's deal now with the people who are trapped in the castles. The walls are
      strong, but they won't help against a horde of goblins

    Dialogs:
    - '"Now all this castle is ours! Oh, I was going to say yours... Let''s talk
      about something else'
    - There isn't much left, Lord. The long-eared ones are huddled in their trees,
      but they don't expect our attack from beneath the roots. Let's go!
